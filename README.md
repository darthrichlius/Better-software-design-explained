# Learning-Snippets

Learning Snippets is a personal initiave which goal is to provide ready-to-use snippets for my projects. The secondary goal is to use the source as an inspiration to create new concepts or a reference for my editorial projects.

The objectives are in line with my different "duties" as a Senior Software Engineer but also a Technical Blogger and Trainer.

This project is scallable and will grow along with my inspiration.
