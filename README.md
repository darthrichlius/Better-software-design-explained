# Better Software Design Explained

A collection of useful software engineering design patterns and actionable clean code guidance to build better software and systems from the first try.

**TL;DR**: [Jump to concepts](#concepts)

## CONTEXT

This is a personal initiative whose goal is to provide ready-to-use snippets for my projects.
It helps enforce best practices to build sustainable, reliable, and optimized solutions faster.
The secondary goal is to use the source as an inspiration to create new concepts or a reference for my editorial projects.

### Key Value

Resources are actionable.
That means you have access not only to a wiki but also to **resources to play with**.
For example, the "23 Design Patterns with TypeScript in Action" repository is provided with unit testing that follows functional scenarios to make the implementation more actionable.

## DOMAINS

The principles cover general best practices in programming like Design Patterns, but also other domains. This is a non-exhaustive list:

- Clean Code & Design Patterns
- Clean Architecture
- Cloud Computing Principles and best practices
- Artificial Intelligence
- Refactoring excellency

## HOW-TO-CONSUME

- The knowledge base is divided into Domains.
- Each knowledge base (or resource) has its own repository.
- This repository is a link collection of all resources.
